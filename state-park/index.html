    <p id="mainpara1"> Located in a scenic setting in the beautiful Ouachita Mountains, Lake Greeson and the Little Missouri River create a destination for outdoor recreation. Situated on Lake Greeson, Daisy State Park is a popular place for fishing and kayaking with rentals available. Lake tours offer views of magnificent rock formations that you may not otherwise see. 
        Seasonal Interpreter will provide special programs, walks, and workshops throughout the summer. Please request a weekly program schedule at the park Visitor Center.
        
        The Little Missouri River also offers impressive fishing for trout and excellent floating in the spring. Other activities include ATV riding on the Bear Cycle Trail. Daisy is near Crater of Diamonds State Park which makes a great day trip from your campsite. There are three YURTs, 100 campsites (26 Class A, 56 Class B, and 18 tent sites), picnic areas, a pavilion, launch ramps, and a playground.
